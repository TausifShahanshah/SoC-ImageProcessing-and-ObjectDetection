I have used Google Colab to code in Python for the given project which is 1. Counting Number of Objects and Area Calculation and 2. Percentage Porosity 

In Number of Objects and Area calculation, I have used libraries such as openCV, Matplotlib and Numpy. I have implemented YOLOv4 in this project to calculate the number of objects and labels of the object. I have also calculated the area of the objects in the image.
I used a group of dog images to detect the number of dogs. The model correctly detects the number of the dogs ie; 4 and labels as dog.
The area covered by the objects in the image as calculated by the model is 328658.5.

In Percentage Porosity calculation of the given image, I have used libraries such as openCV, Matplotlib, Pandas and Numpy to execute the code. I have used different techniques to count number of pixels and pore pixels in the image. 
The percentage porosity that I have achieved is 32.5%.
